Local Lore

We want to create an application that allows a user to find local restaurants, attractions, news, and weather in their area.
They would use this as a guide to see what they can experience and utilize if they wish to check it out.
The user would be able to save restaurants/attractions to a favorites list and be able to access it should they choose.

Basically an local tour guide for anything relevant!
